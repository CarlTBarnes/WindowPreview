Copy the LibSrc files into your x:\Clarion11\Accessory\LibSrc\win folder

Preview a window from the Clarion Designer.

Hover the mouse just below the cpation and a hidden flat button should pop up.

Click the button and explore.

To turn off the Window Preview feature rename the WindowPreviewer.inc in the LibSrc folder.
(That file is included in all generated previews)


If Preview does not work try installing .Net 2.0 and 3.5, and maybe 4.
Look for an *.LOG file in your Clarion or Project folder that may have an exception.
